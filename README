NAME
    Pod::Weaver::Plugin::Eval - Evaluate code

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    In your "weaver.ini":

     [-Eval]
     include_modules = ^Foo::Bar$
     ;include_files  = REGEX
     code = sub { my ($self, %args)=@_; my $document = $args{document}; push @{$document->children}, ... }

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin load modules and evaluates Perl code. It can be used to
    extract stuffs from the module (like some configuration or hash keys)
    and insert it to the POD.

    I first created this module to insert list of border styles and color
    themes contained in %border_styles package variable in
    "Text::ANSITable::BorderStyle::*" modules and %color_themes variable in
    "Text::ANSITable::ColorTheme::*" modules.

    Yes, it's a dirty (and ugly) hack. But it's quick :-)

CONFIGURATION
  include_files => STR
    Value should be a regex, e.g. "/Foo/Bar/".

  include_modules => REGEX
    Value should be a regex, e.g. "^Foo::Bar$".

  code => STR
    Should be something like:

     sub { my ($self, %args) = @_; ... }

    "sub {" and "}" will be added if code does not have it. Code will be
    called with %args containing these keys:

    *   filename => STR

    *   package => STR

    *   args => ARRAY

        The original @_ passed to weave_section(). Note that weave_section()
        is passed:

         ($self, $document, $input)

    *   document => OBJ

        Document object passed to weave_section(). This is the output POD we
        are building and this is what we're mostly interested in, usually.
        It can also be retrieved from "args".

    *   input => OBJ

        The input object passed to weave_section(). It contains information
        about the input (original) document. Can also be retrieved from
        "args".
